# Wavelet-Transform-Coherence-Analysis-for-Time-Series-Signal
This code, as part of my PhD thesis, decomposes the signals into different frequency components over time, providing a time-frequency representation of the data.
This decomposition is particularly useful for capturing non-stationary and time-varying features in the signals. Next, I calculate the coherence between the corresponding frequency components of the two signals.
Coherence measures the degree of similarity or correlation between the signals at different frequencies and ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation.
By examining the coherence values across different frequencies, we can identify the frequency bands where the two signals are significantly correlated.
Monte-Carlo simulation was used to determine the significant coherence threshold
